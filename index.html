          <p>
            I am a 10(+) -year IT professional who enjoys all things technology. I have spent half my career as a manager 
            in some form or fashion, and the other half as a system admin. I have enjoyed working on servers, network 
            design and configuration, but my true love is programming. While scripting in Bash, Python and
            basic Windows batch files - I entered the wonderful world of web development. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The journey has been fun and tedious all at the same time. From my days of home automation to now - technology has always 
            been something I have been passionate about. My journey into IT started by happenstance. I met a man that would try to guide me
            into learning not only programming but IT in general. Thank you Rod for being so kind as to lead me into a rich career.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you look into my projects page - you will see a few different projects that I have created over the years. More recently I have started 
            programming in Python. I also have picked up web development as if you look at the source code for this website - it is built from HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            And later on - I might even throw in a few networking projects I have done - including my own network rack.
